why do i want to program/switch careers
	fun!
	i believe in doing something with my time that i thoroughly enjoy and believe in
	i love animals and i love what i'm doing now, but no real room for growth
	or possibility to take it further
	finding myself on various coding sites/challenges (codesignal, leetcode, projecteuler, etc)
	in most of my free time and that it's what i really enojy - solving problems

why data science?
	i thoughtfully considered the various tracks offered (machine learning, software engineering...)
	and felt data science was the best fit for me
	in fact i found out about springboard via linkedin (user acquistion message)
	who recommended me for the ML program, but i feel the data science program is a better fit
	for what i enjoy doing and what i want to learn and do in the future
	not interested particularly in web/front-end development (html/css/etc)
	have experience in data analysis previously and really enjoyed it (worked with large data sets,
	analyzed, generated, etc) and want to build my skills and pursue this field further
	i like solving puzzles, finding hidden patterns, discovering hidden patterns and testing
	out hypotheses
	interested in data visualization as well, and how it can actually be useful in analyses rather
	than just looking pretty
	learn by doing, that's why i like the idea of project-based curriculum offered by springboard
	

tell me about yourself/background
	highly analytical and motivated
	i like research and love learning
	like problem solving
	believe in spending time on things that really matter (helping others, animals, political causes, etc)
	data science gives you a platform to do something that really matters and can make big impacts
